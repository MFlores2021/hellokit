# hello: A Good Title
A thorough description
A README file is meant for new users of your package. Please include a short example of how this package works using knitr! More detailed tutorials should be added as 
vignettes. The NEWS.md file is meant for prior users and should contain a progressive
list of changes (new features, bug fixes, deprecated features, etc.)
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
